This project follow the tutorial [Vue Online Store with Shopping Cart], but I use [Vue Material] for layout.

## TODO

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
